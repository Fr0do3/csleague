    -If somebody will not be able to attend but they let us know on 5 consecutive occasions, unfortunately they will be ruled out<br>
    -It would be ideal for everybody to record their race in case the Stewards will need footage for an incident investigation (see more at 6. Stewards)<br>

    -If somebody presses ready before the admins say so, they will receive 2 penalty points<br>

    -The Stewards will also hand out penalty points for misbehaving on- and off-track<br>
    -If somebody gets 10 in total, that will result in deleting his penalty points and getting a 1 race ban for the next event they attend<br>
